# BMEG-257-DHF-5


This code repository is apart of our Biomedical Engineering Design course project, where we have built an alternative appratus for the Pfizer vaccine thermal shipper. This repo has all the code for controlling the vairous electronic parts we have, such as: LED, LCD, Servo motors, and a potentiometer. 

## Tech/framework used
Built with:
- C++
- Arduino
- Adafruit PWM Servo Motor Controller 


## Setup
You will need the Arduino IDE or a work environment that has serial communication (such as PlatformIO on VScode)
1. Clone the git repo


```git clone https://github.com/tina190666/BMEG-257-DHF-5/```

2. Change directory


```cd BMEG-257-DHF-5```

3. Open the Arduino IDE (or serial work environment)
4. Verify and upload code to microcontroller
5. Run!

Refe to [here](https://wiki.keyestudio.com/Ks0258_keyestudio_16-channel_Servo_Motor_Drive_Shield), to get more specific information about the Servo Motor Drive Shield that we using. This is driven using Arduino's PWM power. Fun.
